# What is Azure Blob Storage?

- Azure Storage is the Azure platform's managed service for providing cloud storage. Azure Storage is composed of several core services and supporting features. It is highly available, secure, durable, scalable, and redundant. 

- The word ‘Blob’ expands to a Binary Large Object. Blobs include images, text files, videos and audios.

- Azure Blob storage is Microsoft's object storage solution for the cloud and it is optimized for storing massive amounts of unstructured data. 

- Unstructured data is data that doesn't adhere to a particular data model or definition, such as text or binary data.

- With Azure Blob Storage, the files (photos, videos, training documents, etc.), which are known as blobs, are put in containers which function similar to directories. These are then linked to the storage account. 

- One of the big advantages for businesses is that Azure Blob storage allows them to collect all of their content assets in one place. These will then be available all across their different departments and internationally. The speed, scalability, ease of access, and security make such cloud storage very attractive for all mid-sized and large organizations.
